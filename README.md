# Encryption-And-Decryption-Project-Using-RSA-Algorithm

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone.
Its fairly easy to code but is not considered very secure nowadays.
